## Description
Define the scope and constraints for Phase-1 of Noctyl, focused exclusively on LangGraph workflow graph extraction.

## Decisions to Lock
- Supported language(s):
- Supported framework(s):
- Analysis type (static / dynamic):
- Output format(s):

## Explicitly Out of Scope
- Token estimation
- Cost modeling
- Runtime execution
- Non-LangGraph frameworks

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Scope documented
- [ ] In-scope and out-of-scope agreed
