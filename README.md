**Multi-agent workflow token usage estimator** — estimate token usage before you burn through your budget.

Noctyl helps you predict token consumption for multi-agent workflows at both **production** and **prototype** stages, so you can plan costs and avoid surprises.

> **Note:** This is an experimental project.

## What it does

- **Estimates token usage** for multi-agent workflows before execution
- **Supports production-grade and prototype** tooling and pipelines
- **Reduces risk** of unexpected token spend by surfacing estimates upfront

## Status

Experimental — APIs and behavior may change.

---

*Noctyl — know your token usage before you run.*
